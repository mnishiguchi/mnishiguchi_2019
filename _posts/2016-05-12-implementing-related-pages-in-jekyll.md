I wanted to make a list of related pages at the bottom of each post in my Jekyll site.

## Objectives
- Generate a list of related posts based on the attributes of the current page.
- Accept as an argument the number of the posts that will be displayed.
- For a blog post, display other posts that belongs to the same tags as the post does.
- For the other types of pages, display the latest posts.

## [Jekyll variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/)
At first, I was a little bit confused about the usage of these [Jekyll variables](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/). Actually that is the reason I decided to write this post so that I can save time in the future.

- `site.posts`     - A reverse chronological list of all Posts.
- `site.tags[TAG]` - The list of all Posts with tag TAG.
- `page.tags`      - The list of tags to which this post belongs.

## [Liquid filters](https://help.shopify.com/themes/liquid/filters)
I heard that Liquid limits its capability for the safety reason. I realized that it was important to clearly understand what we cannot do with Liquid. Also, I need to get used to Liquid's syntax some of which is very different from Ruby's.

## Pseudo-code
Here is the pseudo-code for logic in this code:

- Create an empty array, `posts_list`
- If the current page has any tags
  + iterate over lists under each tag
    * push all items to `posts_list` unless it is the current page
  + remove duplicate items
  + iterate over `posts_list`
    * generate appropriate HTML
- If the page have no tags
  + iterate over Jekyll's default `site.posts` array
    * generate appropriate HTML

## Implementation
{% raw %}
```html
{% assign posts_list = "" | split: "|" %}

{% if page.tags %}
  {% for each_tag in page.tags %}
    {% for each_post in site.tags[each_tag] %}
      {% if each_post.title != page.title %}
        {% assign posts_list = posts_list | push: each_post %}
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  {% endfor %}
  {% assign posts_list = posts_list | uniq %}
{% else %}
  {% assign posts_list = site.posts %}
{% endif %}

<ul class="related-posts">
  {% for post in posts_list limit:include.limit %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}">
        {{ post.title }}
      </a>
      <br />
      {% include post_meta.html %}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```
{% endraw %}
